# Verifying an Android build

A change that compiles only in the editor still requires a real
build before it ships. Use this skill before declaring a change
"done", "ready", or "looks good" after any edit to the paths
above. This skill is the verification-procedure SSOT; other skills
cite it rather than describing the verification themselves.

When invoked manually, `$ARGUMENTS` overrides the default Gradle
task. Default is `assembleStableDebug`.

## Procedure

1. **Check format and code style.**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew spotlessCheck
   ```

   On failure, run `./gradlew spotlessApply` to auto-fix. ktlint
   findings that Spotless cannot auto-fix
   (e.g. `compose:modifier-missing-check`) need a manual edit; do
   not bypass with `suppressLintsFor`.

2. **Build a debug APK.**

   ```bash
   ./gradlew assembleStableDebug
   ```

   Expect `BUILD SUCCESSFUL`. APK at
   `app/build/outputs/apk/stable/debug/app-stable-debug.apk`. `assembleStableDebug`
   also builds the LIVE map web payload (`:app:buildWebMap` runs
   pnpm + Vite over `webmap/`), so webmap regressions surface here.

3. **Run lint** for any change touching the manifest, themes, or
   resources:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew lint
   ```

   Read the report (`app/build/reports/lint-results-*.{xml,html}`)
   and summarise: new errors (blocking), new warnings grouped by
   category, and any baseline regressions. Never suppress — fix at
   source (AGENTS.md#no-suppress) or surface the finding to the user
   for a decision.

4. **Run unit tests** if you touched code that has corresponding
   tests:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

   If you touched `app/src/test/.../catalog/` or
   `testfixtures/Dashboard*`, also run
   `./gradlew :app:generateCatalog -Pfemto.catalog.filter=head-unit-853x512__medium__light__right__bottom`
   — the generator is category-excluded from `test`, so nothing else
   exercises it locally.

5. **Check the docs site** if you touched anything under `docs/`:

   ```bash
   pnpm --dir docs run check && pnpm --dir docs run build
   ```

   Both must pass; `build` includes the dist link check that fails on
   a link missing the Pages base. CI runs the same two commands in the
   `docs-site` job.

6. **Report** explicitly what was run and what passed:

   - "Ran `./gradlew spotlessCheck` — passed."
   - "Ran `./gradlew assembleStableDebug` — BUILD SUCCESSFUL."
   - "Ran `./gradlew lint` — no new findings."

   Do not claim success generically; cite the commands.

7. **On red, fix the root cause** per `AGENTS.md#no-suppress`, and
   do not skip hooks. If a Compose API is experimental, opt in at
   file level — never at module level.

CI parity: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the same four tasks
(`spotlessCheck`, `lint`, `test`, `assembleStableDebug`), split across
three parallel jobs (`static-checks`, `unit-tests`, `assemble`) for
wall-clock speed, plus `verifyRoborazziStableDebug` alongside `test` in
CI only (screenshot verification against goldens recorded on the
CI runner OS), plus the `docs-site` job (`pnpm run check` + `pnpm
run build` under `docs/`), plus a one-entry `generateCatalog
-Pfemto.catalog.filter=…` smoke render in the `unit-tests` leg
(CI-only). If this step list changes, change `ci.yml` in the same
commit.

## Common failure modes and fixes

| Failure | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `This API is experimental and is likely to change` | Variable-font `FontVariation` use | Add `@file:OptIn(androidx.compose.ui.text.ExperimentalTextApi::class)` at the top of the file (see `.claude/rules/fonts.md`) |
| `Unresolved reference: libs.<x>` | Forgot to add the alias in `libs.versions.toml` | Add to `[libraries]` (and `[plugins]` for plugins), then re-sync. See `.claude/rules/dependencies.md`. |
| `Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar` not found | `com.google.android.material:material` removed | Re-add it in `libs.versions.toml` and `app/build.gradle.kts` |
| `:app:buildWebMap` fails | TypeScript / Vite error under `webmap/` | Fix the webmap source; Gradle provisions Node and pnpm itself. Keep Vite's `build.target` at the WebView floor (`AGENTS.md#tech-stack`) |
| Compose Compiler version mismatch | The catalog was bypassed — `kotlin-compose` shares `version.ref = "kotlin"` in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` and cannot diverge through it (`.claude/rules/dependencies.md`) | Restore the shared `version.ref` |
